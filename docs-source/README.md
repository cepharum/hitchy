# Welcome!

This is the manual for the Hitchy server-side application framework. 

This framework starts lean and relies on [plugins](plugins) to extend the very small but powerful set of features included with its core that's providing just this:

* Discovering Extensions
* [Request Routing](internals/routing-basics)

Those features comply with our [basic design principles](principles).

See our [tutorials](tutorials/) for getting started.


## Why "Hitchy"?

We've started developing this framework while using SailsJS for creating applications. We basically were great fans of ExpressJS back then. But SailsJS wasn't quite as convincing. That's why we've started developing our own framework. 

Thus we intended to develop our own framework for all what was missing in ExpressJS and make it integrate as a middleware there. So, it is hitching and that's why we called it _hitchy_. Aside from that this name was sticking and free.

Guess what! Hitchy works great on top of ExpressJS even today. However, Hitchy is great on its own, too, and so we love to use it without ...
