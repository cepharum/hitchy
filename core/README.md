This folder is designed to contain hitchy extensions distributed as part of its
core package. The folder is searched for extensions the same way `node_modules`
folder is checked for any installed extensions. Thus you might put extensions
here using one sub-folder per extension containing at least the extension's
`hitchy.json` file.
